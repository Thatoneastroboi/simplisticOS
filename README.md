Simplistic os

Chain of command:
Master domain
Domains


Domains store shortcuts for programs which are actually online
And are downloaded and deleted every time they are opened
Or closed.


When booted off the computer stores the domains in the cache 
And redownloads the system files to remove any extra files or 
Viruses.

DAP domain access point
The only application the stays on the computer allows
For domains to be downloaded
